# Project Summary:

This project aims to predict a target variable using regression models. It uses a comprehensive approach, starting from basic models like the Dummy Regressor to more complex ones like Decision Tree Regressors. Hyperparameter tuning is also employed to refine the performance of these models. Throughout the project, the models' performances are evaluated using R2 score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## How to run the project on your system:

1. **Setting up the environment:**

   First, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, the easiest way to get started is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), which bundles Python, Jupyter, and many scientific libraries.

2. **Install required libraries:**

   If you've installed Anaconda, most of these libraries will already be available. If not, or if you're missing any, you can install them using `pip`:


3. **Clone/download the project:**

If you've received this project from a repository, clone it using `git`:


This will open a browser window with Jupyter's dashboard. Click on the `.ipynb` file to open it.

5. **Run the Notebook:**

Once inside the notebook, you can run cells individually by clicking on them and pressing `Shift + Enter`. To run the entire notebook, click on `Kernel` in the top menu and then `Restart & Run All`.
